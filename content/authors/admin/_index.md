Hi, I am a Research Scientist at Mahdy Research Academy, Bangladeshâ€™s first [Quantum Research Facility](https://sites.google.com/view/mahdyresearchacademy/home?authuser=0). At MRA, I supervise 22 research groups on Machine Learning, Computer vision, Medical Image Analaysis and Quantum Machine Learning research. I also enjoy teaching classical and quantum machine learning to a vibrant class of 300 students. My research is broadly focused on optimizing complex Quantum and Machine Learning algorithms. I also work as a Software/ Machine Learning Engineer at [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/alifelham). You can learn more about my seven-year-long industrial experience from my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alif-elham/). Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email. Have a great day!
