abstract: "Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on life satisfaction is
incumbent for understanding how individuals experience their lives and influencing interventions
targeted at enhancing mental health and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured
using analog, complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the potential for machine
learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction. We constructed machine learning models that predict
life satisfaction with a high accuracy of 93.04% and a 73.30% macro F1-score. The dataset comes
from a government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature learning
techniques, we extracted 27 significant questions for assessing contentment, making the study highly
reproducible, simple, and easily interpretable. We have further analyzed the correlation between
primary determinants with different age brackets, and found that health condition is most important
determinant across all ages. Our model is deployed on a public server, ensuring anyone can take the
test. We highlight the advantages of machine learning methods for predicting life satisfaction and
the significance of XAI for interpreting and validating these predictions. This study demonstrates
how machine learning and XAI can jointly contribute to building trust and understanding in using
AI to investigate human behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being."
