Disabled people are people who have mental or physical limitation so they depend on someone to support them in doing their daily life needs and jobs. Although disabled people are a minority and they are normally ignored, they are still a part of the society. The statistics show that the proportion of disabled people in the world rose from 10 percent in the seventies of the last century to 15 percent so far. The number of handicapped exceeds a billion people all over the world, occupied about 15 percent of the worldâ€™s population, as a result of an aging population and the increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, blood and psychological diseases that are related with disabilities and impairments.

Awareness of disability-inclusive development is increasing globally. It is important to consider sus- tainable design for accessibility in all aspects of physical development. In addition to uplifting this morality, we deployed our solution in hoping to remove the inaccessibility, discriminatory prejudice and stigma in society. here has been a surge of disability independence so much so that 26 July is celebrated as World Disability Independence day. To boost this noble mission of disability independence, we have come up with software that bridges the gap between people with disability and healthcare services. The current existing traditional healthcare portals present a huge language and structural barrier for these people.One of the ways to assist them to be self-reliant is to improve accessibility. So we have made our system guided and easily graspable for these people in need.

Our system used website development methodologies to connect the disabled people with the hospi- tals, doctors, pharmacies and diagnostic centers all over the country just by pressing a few buttons. This system aims to glorify disability independence and make the life of disabled people better, self-sufficient and content.
